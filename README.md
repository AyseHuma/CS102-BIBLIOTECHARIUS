To start the application first start server by running ServerMain.java on one computer. Then open ClientTester on another computer or the same computer (possible to run multiple instances of it). In order for the ClientTester classes to connect, the IP address must be changed to the server's IPv4 adress. The databases and server files do not need to be present on the client side. The project managed the dependencies with Maven. JavaFX was used to build GUI and JDBC for database connectivity.
